## üåü Project Overview

This project is a modern web application designed to mimic the core user interface and Browse experience of Netflix. Built with a focus on a responsive design and dynamic content fetching, it serves as a robust foundation for understanding frontend development, API integration, and user authentication in a practical context.

It leverages client-side React for an interactive user interface, styled efficiently with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first approach. User management is handled by Firebase, while real movie and TV show data is pulled directly from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
